# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implementation in JavaScript. Currently, the project focuses on the core game logic with console output, but it's being developed to include a full front-end interface.

## Features

- Three different implementations of computer choice selection:
  1. Original version with number range checks
  2. Revised if/else version with probability ranges
  3. Switch statement version for cleaner code
- Ready for front-end integration (HTML structure already set up)

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure with script link
- `javascript.js` - Core game logic with computer choice functions
- `styles.css` - (Future) Styling for the front-end

## Usage

Currently, you can test the computer's random choice by running the JavaScript file and checking the console output. The `getComputerScience3()` function is being called as an example.

```javascript
console.log(getComputerScience3()); // Outputs either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissor"
```

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Front-end interface with buttons for user selection
- Game state tracking (wins, losses, ties)
- Visual feedback for game results
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. View the console (F12 or right-click -> Inspect -> Console) to see the computer's random choice

Note: The full interactive game will be implemented in the front-end version.
